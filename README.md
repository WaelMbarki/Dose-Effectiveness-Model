### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model using neural networks to assess the effectiveness of various doses.

### Tools

-Jupyter Notebook [Download here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

### Steps

1-Initialize Weights and Biases: Set up the neural network's initial weights and biases to begin training.

2-Gradient Descent on Bias Final Parameter: Apply gradient descent to optimize the final bias parameter during training.

3-Train the Model: Feed the training data into the neural network and update the model's parameters.

4-Make Predictions: Use the trained model to predict dose effectiveness on new data.
